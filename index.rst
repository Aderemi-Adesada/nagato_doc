**Nagato** is a blender project management and version control addon that helps you manage your files and projects.
Shino helps to reduce the stress of organizing your files manually which is prone to error. While working on my personal
projects in blender, I found that I spend almost 40% of my time searching for files, hence I created Shino to solve that problem. 

Shino also helps you to version your files. So when you have an idea you can always try it out without worrying about losing your progress
or duplicating your file.

Shino also makes re-using assets from other projects easy. It also keeps track of the time you have spent
on a file/project and how much it cost, and this can help when billing your clients.
